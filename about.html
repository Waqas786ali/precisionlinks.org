            <h3>Our Vision</h3>
            <p>
                Scientific and technological advancement of a country demands an organized and globally connected
                metrology infrastructure. Scientific and legal metrology systems are normally taken care by public
                sector organizations like National Metrology Institutes and relevant ministries.
                However, industrial metrology systems are dependent on traceable calibration services provided by
                private sector calibration laboratories.
                In developing countries inadequate level of metrology education / awareness and incomplete
                traceability of measurement results bars the local production from highly competitive global market.
                Hence, Precision links is with the aim of helping the manufacturers in building up quility by design to meet ever-challenging market demands and to ensure patient safety.
